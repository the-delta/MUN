        <h3>SVVIMUN is the first ever University based Model United Nations Conference taking place in Indore. With an expectation of more than 500+ delegates to be a part of the conference, we are more than confident of having three days of wonderful debate along with a lot of social events and gatherings taking place as well. SVVIMUN shall also see some of the best panel discussions with some of Indore’s most eminent personalities from the social, economic and political spheres participating in them.<br />
          SVVIMUN is going to be a three day celebration of the rich culture and heritage that Indore boasts of and most importantly, a celebration of MUNning in Indore.<br />

          All the agendas in the committees are based around the theme- “World Issue”. Both these regions of the world have a lot of issues in every possible sphere that have to be dealt with in an effective manner by all the different United Nations bodies. Our effort is a humble attempt in this direction.<br />
