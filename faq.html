        <li><strong>What is Model UN?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Model United Nations is a simulation of the UN General Assembly and other multilateral bodies. In Model UN, students step into the shoes of ambassadors from UN member states to debate current issues on the organization’s agenda. While playing their roles as ambassadors, student “delegates” make speeches, prepare draft resolutions, negotiate with allies and adversaries, resolve conflicts, and navigate the Model UN conference rules of procedure – all in the interest of mobilizing international cooperation to resolve problems that affect countries all over the world.</p>
        <p>Before playing out their ambassadorial roles in a Model UN simulation, students research the issue that their committee will address. Model UN participants learn how the international community acts on its concerns about topics including peace and security, human rights, the environment, food and hunger, economic development and globalization. Model UN delegates also look closely at the needs, goals and foreign policies of the countries they will represent at the event. The insights they gain from their exploration of history, geography, culture, economics and science contribute to the authenticity of the simulation when the role playing gets under way. The delegates’ in-depth knowledge of their countries guarantees a lively and memorable experience.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Who participates in Model UN?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The popularity of Model UN continues to grow and more than 400,000 middle school, high school and college/university students worldwide participate every year.<br>
        Many of today’s leaders in law, government, business and the arts participated in Model UN during their academic careers.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>What topics are discussed at Model UN conferences?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The agenda items discussed in committee vary at each conference. Most conferences tend to focus on current affairs issues that are being discussed in the United Nations. These issues can highlight political, financial and/or social concerns. However, the task of some committees might be to address hypothetical concerns or issues from the past or future. For example, many conferences have “crisis” committees, in which delegates must react to a hypothetical or actual crisis situation. Other conferences host historical or future Security Council simulations.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>What is a Model UN delegate?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Model UN delegate is a student who assumes the role of an ambassador to the United Nations in a Model UN simulation. Prior to a conference or event, a Model UN delegate does not need extensive experience in international relations. Anyone can participate in Model UN, so long as they have the ambition to learn something new and to work with people to try and make a difference in the world. Model UN students tend to go on to become great leaders in politics, law, business, education and medicine, such as the people mentioned above.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Why should I participate in Model UN?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Model UN promotes students’ and teachers’ interest in world around them and broadens a student’s knowledge in a variety of subjects. Model UN also teaches vital skills in negotiation, public speaking, problem solving, conflict resolution, research and communication. Model UN also gives students and teachers the opportunity to meet interesting new people and make new friends.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>What are the educational benefits of participating in Model UN?</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For over 60 years, teachers and students have benefited from and enjoyed this interactive learning experience. It not only involves young people in the study and discussion of global issues, but also encourages the development of skills useful throughout their lives, such as research, writing, public speaking, problem solving, consensus building, conflict resolution and compromise and cooperation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>What is a Model UN conference?</strong><br>
        Some Model UN exercises take place in the classroom and others are school-wide. Model UN events that are regional, national or international are called conferences. Conferences are much larger, with participants from all over the United States and the world. More than one million people have participated in Model UN conferences around the world since the activity became popular. Today there are well over 400 conferences that take place in 52 countries. Conference can have as few as 30 students or as many as 3,000.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>How should I prepare for my Model UN conference?</strong><br>
        Researching is the first and most important step in preparing for a conference. Not only is it necessary to have a grasp on information about the country you are representing and its position on the policies being discussed, it is also important to understand the UN body that your committee is representing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>What should I wear to a Model UN conference?</strong><br>
        Dressing professionally and appropriately is an important aspect of Model United Nations preparations. Just like being polite and having proper manners, dressing appropriately is an important way to show respect for the nation you are representing, for your fellow delegates and for the United Nations. At some conferences, delegates may wear their own national dress; however, most conferences require western business attire. Western business attire, or international standard business attire, serves as customary dress for workplaces. It includes wearing a suit, which is made up of pants, a matching jacket, a button-down dress shirt, and a tie. Conservative dress shoes and socks are also important.The main thing to remember is to always insure that your appearance is tidy and put together, and that you are well covered.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>What is caucusing?</strong><br>
        Caucusing is informal debate that occurs during a Model UN conference. It serves as an important method of discussion because it allows for greater participation and consensus building. Caucusing can be either “moderated” when speakers are called on by the chair after raising their placards or “un-moderated”, which is a designated time for delegates without the intervention of the chair to have discussion and work on resolutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>How can I feel more confident speaking in public?</strong><br>
        Public speaking is a big component of a Model UN conference and an essential skill to ensure that your nation’s concerns are represented. Speeches are made by individual nations throughout committee sessions from the speaker’s list and during moderated caucuses. Negotiation can also occur on an individual and informal level; however, it is important to present your nation’s views clearly and eloquently to the entire committee.</li>
